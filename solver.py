                         TRITOWERS SOLVER
======================================================================

A rank-only TriTowers solver.

CARD STRUCTURE
--------------

Standard 52-card deck:

    28 tableau cards
     1 waste card
    23 stock cards
    ----------------
    52 cards total

Suits are completely ignored.

There are four copies of every rank:

    A  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  J  Q  K


TABLEAU POSITIONS
-----------------

                         [01]       [02]       [03]

                    [04] [05]   [06] [07]   [08] [09]

               [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]

        [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]


The bottom row is positions 19-28.


SOLVER BEHAVIOUR
----------------

1. Ask whether the complete tableau is known.

2. Ask whether the stock order is known.

3. Ask for the waste card.

4. Enter the known cards as quickly as possible.

5. If only the bottom row is known, upper cards are requested
   ONLY when they become exposed.

6. The solver looks for a guaranteed route first.

7. If no guaranteed route is available, it chooses the route
   with the highest estimated probability of success.

8. Solver moves require NO confirmation.

9. If the stock is unknown, the user only enters the card
   that actually appears when a draw occurs.

CARD INFORMATION
----------------

This solver ignores SUITS completely.

Only the rank/number of each card matters.

There are four copies of every rank:

    A  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  J  Q  K


THE 52 CARDS
------------

    28 tableau cards
     1 waste card
    23 stock cards
    ----------------
    52 cards total


TABLEAU
-------

The tableau is the group of 28 cards arranged into the
three towers.


WASTE
-----

The waste is the single card currently showing.

A tableau card can be played when its rank is immediately
above or below the waste card.

A and K are treated as adjacent.


STOCK
-----

The stock is the pile of cards that you draw when there
are no playable tableau cards.

There are ALWAYS 23 stock cards at the start.


EXPOSED
-------

A card is exposed when BOTH cards covering it have been
removed.

If you only know the bottom row, you do NOT need to enter
the other tableau cards initially.

The solver will ask for an unknown card when it becomes
exposed.


GUARANTEED ROUTE
----------------

The solver first searches for a route that is guaranteed
to work based on the information currently available.


STATISTICAL ROUTE
-----------------

If no guaranteed route can be established, the solver
simulates possible future cards and chooses the move with
the highest estimated chance of success.


DURING PLAY
-----------

You do NOT need to confirm the solver's moves.

When a card becomes exposed, simply enter its rank.

When an unknown stock card is drawn, simply enter the rank
that appeared.

The solver then immediately continues.
